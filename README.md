# Draco

Draco is highly-extensible set of open source services making it easy to deploy, serve, and manage trusted first and third-party application extensions, securely and at scale, anywhere.

See [documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/draco/blob/master/doc/README.md) for additional details. 


## Getting started
Draco is a containerized platform intended to be run on Azure. Assets are available to deploy the Azure infrastructure, build and deploy the Draco services, and validate the environment is running properly.  To get started, see the [setup instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/draco/blob/master/doc/setup/README.md) to deploy Draco in your Azure subscription.
