# Why Draco?

## Quick and seamless updates
As your customer base grows, pushing software updates can become a complex and arduous task, especially when your customers are on-premises. Cloud-based extensions can be pushed to millions of users in seconds allowing you to react much more quickly to constantly changing customer needs.

## Partner ecosystem foundation
Draco lays a solid foundation for a rich partner ecosystem that revolves around your existing product offerings.

## More upsell opportunities
Upselling can be a major challenge especially for traditionally on-premises product offerings. Draco’s AI-enabled intelligent catalog makes it easy to drive targeted, personalized extension marketing campaigns.

## Better understand customer behavior and discover actionable insights
Draco generates rich, detailed usage information that can be used to drive analytics and business intelligence enabling you to discover actionable insights into how your customers are using your software.

## Low-risk cloud spend
The infrastructure required to host Draco is minimal requiring only a small up-front investment.

The real revenue is driven by the extensions themselves. Extensions can be scaled out then back in as needed based on customer demand. Since extensions can be provisioned “just-in-time”, cloud spend can be easily and safely controlled.
